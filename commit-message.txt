feat(utilities): implement Bootstrap-inspired utility generator

- Add utility API for generating utility classes based on utility maps
- Create utility generator system in 02-tools folder
- Implement utility classes for display, flex, margin, padding, text alignment, font weight, and opacity
- Fix breadcrumb component string interpolation issue
- Enable all component imports in _index.scss

This commit adds a comprehensive utility generator system inspired by Bootstrap 5.
The system processes utility maps from the 99-utilities folder and generates
responsive utility classes. It also fixes a build error related to the breadcrumb
component divider string interpolation.
